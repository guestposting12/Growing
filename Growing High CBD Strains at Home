CBD, or cannabidiol, is a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant that has been shown to have numerous health benefits. As the popularity of CBD continues to grow, more and more people are interested in growing their own high CBD strains at home. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know about growing CBD strains, including how to choose the right strain, tips for growing and harvesting, and more.
Understanding High CBD Strains
Before we dive into the specifics of growing high CBD strains, let's first go over what they are and how they differ from high THC strains. High CBD strains are cannabis plants that have been bred to contain high levels of CBD and low levels of THC. THC is the compound in cannabis that is responsible for its psychoactive effects, so high CBD strains are non-intoxicating.
Benefits of Growing High CBD Strains
There are several benefits to growing high CBD strains at home, including:
●	Control over the growing process: By growing your own high CBD strains, you have complete control over the growing process and can ensure that your plants are grown organically and without harmful chemicals.
●	Cost savings: Purchasing CBD products can be expensive, but growing your own CBD strains can be a cost-effective way to access the benefits of CBD.
●	Variety: When you grow your own CBD strains, you have access to a wider variety of strains than you might find in a dispensary.
Choosing the Right Strain for Your Needs
When choosing a high CBD strain, there are several factors to consider, including the following:
●	CBD to THC ratio: The ratio of CBD to THC in a strain can vary widely. Some high CBD strains have a 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC, while others may have a CBD to THC ratio of 20:1 or higher. Consider your individual needs and preferences when choosing a strain.
